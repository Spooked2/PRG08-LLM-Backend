Item #: SCP-914

Object Class: Safe

Special Containment Procedures: Only personnel who submit a formal request and receive approval from site command may operate 914. SCP-914 is to be kept in research cell 109-B with two guard personnel on duty at all times. Any researchers entering 109-B are to be accompanied by at least one guard for the entirety of testing. A full list of tests to be carried out must be given to all guard personnel on duty; any deviation from this list will result in termination of testing, forcible removal of personnel from 109-B, and formal discipline at site command’s discretion.

WARNING: At this time, no testing of biological matter is allowed. Refer to document 109-B:117. Applying the “Rough” setting to explosive materials is not advised.

Description: SCP-914 is a large clockwork device weighing several tons and covering an area of eighteen square meters, consisting of screw drives, belts, pulleys, gears, springs and other clockwork. It is incredibly complex, consisting of over eight million moving parts comprised mostly of tin and copper, with some wooden and cloth items observed. Observation and probing have showed no electronic assemblies or any form of power other than the “Mainspring” under the “Selection Panel”. Two large booths 3mx2.1mx2.1m (10ftx7ftx7ft) are connected via copper tubes to the main body of SCP-914, labeled “Intake” and “Output”. Between them is a copper panel with a large knob with a small arrow attached. The words Rough, Coarse, 1:1, Fine, and Very Fine are positioned at points around the knob. Below the knob is a large “key” that winds the “mainspring”.

When an object is placed in the Intake Booth, a door slides shut, and a small bell sounds. If the knob is turned to any position and the key wound up, SCP-914 will “refine” the object in the booth. No energy is lost in the process, and the object appears to be in stasis until the Output Booth door is opened. Intense observation and testing have not shown how SCP-914 accomplishes this, and no test object has ever been observed inside SCP-914 during the “refining” process. The process takes between five and ten minutes, depending on the size of the object being refined.

Note to all Researchers:
Please include your name on all records, along with date and total number of items "refined".

Researchers are responsible for all "Output". Should damage or loss of life occur, the researcher will be subject to administrative review and possible disciplinary action.

Biological testing has been suspended. Any biological testing must be cleared by O5 Command.

Test 914-0101
Name: Dr. Gears
Date: ██/██/20██
Total Items: Four clockwork pocket watch, belonging to Dr. Gears

Input: One gold-plated pocket watch
Setting: Fine
Output: Small clockwork bird. When the tail is pressed, it produces a robin's call.

Input: One gold-plated pocket watch
Setting: Fine
Output: Toy clockwork train engine.

Input: One gold-plated pocket watch
Setting: Fine
Output: Miniature grandfather clock, fully functional.

Input: One gold-plated pocket watch
Setting: Fine
Output: Small metal sculpture of a piano.

Note: It appears there is a high level of randomness when SCP-914 "refines" an item. However, it seems to preserve some elements of its original composition, in this example, clockworks. This is not a law, but a high probability. Refine a metal bar, and you're more likely to get a simple metal object than an internal combustion engine. Both, however, are possible. - Dr. Gears

Test 914-0102
Name: Dr. Gears
Date: ██/██/████
Total Items: Three copies of all documentation, photographs, and test logs accumulated in relation to SCP-914.

Input: One copy of SCP-914 documentation
Setting: 1:1
Output: Folder containing all previously entered documents, arranged in chronological order.

Input: One copy of SCP-914 documentation
Setting: Fine
Output: Hard-bound book containing 400 pages. No diagrams, photos, or other visual aids of any kind are included. The pages appear to be solid black, but microscopic examination shows each page to be covered in approximately twenty thousand characters. The text has no correlation with any known writing style, and is not in a linear format, with "sentences" constructed from individual characters spread out between many pages. Each sentence requires an exceedingly complex formula to decode, with each formula unique to each sentence.

Note: Current decoding work has resulted in two partially translated sentences after 225 work-hours. Item appears to be a record of the internal structure of SCP-914.

Input: One copy of SCP-914 documentation
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Single sheet of paper. Weight is exactly the same as the entered documentation. The sheet appears to be a single page from the entered SCP-914 documentation, however when flipped over to the right, the reverse side is the following page in sequence. When flipped over to the left, the opposite side is the preceding page in sequence. No new documentation is included, but this item is significantly easier to store, if more time-consuming to browse.

Note: It's screwing with us, you know that right? I don't CARE if it's been proven that it has no self-awareness, this thing is LAUGHING at us! - General ████████

Note: There seems to be some difficulty as to the meaning of "fine" and "coarse" on the settings; the machine appears to be capable of refining input based either on a scale of complexity (loss of entropy accompanied by increase in connectivity between components and/or acquisition of subjective meaning) or of simplification (separation into composite materials and loss of meaning). - Dr. Gears

Test 914-0119
Name: Dr. von Hildebrandt
Date: 26/03/2014
Total Items: One set photocopies and duplicates of lab notes and other research material on SCP-914.

Input: One set of research materials
Setting: Fine
Output: One leather-bound tome, 54cm x 42cm, 256 vellum pages, with title written in gold leaf. Language of the title and the contents were at first unidentifiable, and were later discovered to be an old dialect of Finnish. The contents are written in calligraphy, and more than half the pages are elaborately illuminated with colored inks and gold and silver leaf. Once translated, the contents proved to be identical to the contents of the input material, arranged chronologically. The tome has been radiocarbon dated to the early 11th century C.E.

Anachronistically, a leather pocket is sewn into the inside back cover, and this pocket contains what appears to be a modern compact disc, 10cm in diameter. Data on this disc is encoded by an unknown codec. Attempts to divine the codec and decipher the data are ongoing.

Note: It's a pity the contents of this tome are classified. It's a piece worthy of any museum. I've never seen such exquisite calligraphy. The illuminations may prove to be the most interesting part of the book, though. They often portray clockworks and related mechanical parts as well as some of the input or output objects; possibly they relate in a direct rather than abstract way to the operation of SCP-914 as described on the illuminated pages. - Dr. von Hildebrandt

Input: One note.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One note of similar size containing an excerpt from the essay 'An Essay Concerning Human Understanding' by Philosopher John Locke reading:
'This Source of Ideas, every Man has wholly in himself … And though it be not Sense, as having nothing to do with external Objects; yet it is very like it, and might properly enough be called internal Sense.'

Note: The goal of this test was communicating with SCP-914 and discovering if it's self-aware. Let's…write that one up as 'inconclusive'. - Dr. Veritas.

Setting: Very Fine
Output: One silver ring engraved with the phrase 'in loving memory of █████ █████'. █████ █████ is confirmed to be a deceased relative of D-23387. Object placed into containment.

Note: This, combined with the last test, seems to strongly suggest that SCP-914 acts on the 'meaning' humans apply to objects, rather than any self-aware view of them. This certainly explains some of the behavior of SCP-914, but I still feel like we're missing something. - Dr. Geralds

Input: One damage-resistant DVD copy of 1999 motion picture "The Matrix"
Setting: Fine
Output: One Blu-Ray drive readable copy of 1999 motion picture "The Matrix", exact disc format unknown. As well as possessing the high resistance of the first "Fine" output, the "Extras" section of this disc was found to contain twenty thousand times more material than present on the market product, of which SCP-914's version included (but was not limited to): all footage shot for behind-the-scenes featurettes; complete footage of every actor and actress auditions by film's directors, regardless of final employment; all raw unedited footage shot by main cameras for "The Matrix"; all 3D models and 2D assets used to create visual effects for "The Matrix"; every sound effect and musical cue in isolated audio files, including all unused material, with full Hollywood orchestration for concepts scrapped or forgotten by the film's composer, plus dozens of remixes for licensed tracks.

Note: After multiple tests to ensure minimal levels of danger, disc was included in carefully-constructed anonymous package designated for delivery to household of one L███ W████████. Due to last-second discovery of sensitive production notes on disc that could jeopardize stability of film's parent production company, package was intercepted halfway to destination.

Input: One Blu-Ray drive readable copy of 1999 motion picture "The Matrix", exact disc format unknown
Setting: Fine
Output: One ████████-readable physical storage medium. Object initially unreadable. However, after eight months of development, a prototype for a new kind of storage reader (████████) was built by Foundation researchers. Upon successful reading, researchers found object to contain a bewildering array of data. Dr. ██████ estimated that 99.999926% of content is entire raw, non-anomalous █████ ███ █████ ██████ ██ ███ █████ ████ dating back to roughly 1877. The new unit of storage also features a 30-hour-long documentary series ("A History Tinted Green") which explores how "The Matrix" fits into this timeline. Various figures are interviewed in a featureless white room by what appears to be a young K█████ R█████. Of note is a joint interview of Samuel Clemens and Joseph Campbell.

Note 1: Dr. █████, a noted film enthusiast, entered a destructively excited emotional state upon learning of breadth of content, and, for project's protection, has been denied access to laboratory for study's duration. Requests for specific data from the object, however, are not to be rejected. No extraordinary data handling rules currently require enforcement, although this may change if Dr. █████'s interest becomes a dangerous obsession. The object will be tested to discern if recreation of new medium falls within safe limits.

Input: One DVD copy of 1999 motion picture "The Matrix"
Setting: Coarse
Output: One heavily-worn VHS home video of Japanese schoolchildren acting out 1999 motion picture "The Matrix" in backyard.

Output: One black sphere, assumed to be a single continuous speaker. When approached by D-9566, object scanned his head, emitted a sharp electronic beep, and began to emit sound at around 150 decibels. Mild structural damage was done to the test chamber, and all personnel within 500 m of the chamber sustained hearing damage of varying degrees, from temporary damage to permanent loss. Activation event was ended when Agent Kane opened fire on the object with his sidearm. While these shots missed the object, they did impact with D-9566, killing him and ceasing the event.

Note: I can't believe the last thing I ever heard was Barry Manilow. We couldn't have found a D-Class with better music taste? - Dr. Maguire

Input: One £10 note
Setting: 1:1
Output: HK$100

Note: Hong Kong was previously British territory prior to 1997. It is unknown whether SCP-914 chose HKD by chance or if it chose this currency due to Hong Kong's prior association with Great Britain, although the fact that it chose to use a note from the pre-handover era lends to the latter theory. Also of note is that HK$100 was, at the time of the test, almost equal in value to the £10 used as an input.

Input: One £10 note
Setting: 1:1
Output: Two £5 notes, both from the same year as the input.

Output: One lithium-ion battery, manufactured by the Chinese company Hunan Shanshan Toda Advanced Materials Co., Ltd.

Input: One lithium-ion battery
Setting: Fine
Output: One object that resembles an unmarked lithium-ion battery. Closer inspection revealed that much of the internal mass of the battery had been converted into a radioactive isotope of [REDACTED], deriving power from its nuclear decay, with a design very similar to that used in many spacecraft. Object placed into storage.

Input: One lithium-ion battery
Setting: Very Fine
Output: When the output door opened, air rushed into the output chamber as if a vacuum had been present within. The object is a black cube with two electrical nodes on the top, 15 cm across, and weighing exactly the weight of the input battery plus the air in the chamber. The object is unmarked, with the exception of a small printing on one side, warning users that the object contained antimatter, and advising caution. Antimatter composition of object has not yet been confirmed, but has shown no limit to energy capacity. Object currently under testing.

Note: I think we should refrain from putting anything with a lot of potential energy into SCP-914 in the future. If the pressure wave from the air had damaged the output, all of Site-██ could have been destroyed. Not a pleasant thought. - Dr. Geralds

Testing with a few voluntary subjects shows that wrapping them up in the blanket, such that it covers around 80% of their body, results in a sense of security and well-being. Subjects wrapped in it and laid on their back report drowsiness and lose consciousness exactly 300 seconds later. The subject remains unconscious until the blanket is removed, at which point they awaken, reporting a restful sleep. Additionally, during this rest period, minor injuries and afflictions disappear, including scrapes, bruises, and in one case, a nasty cold.

Note: Well, that's enough from me for tonight. Someone wake me at 8, will you? - Dr. Hadian

Test 914-0155
Name: Dr. Collins
Date: 17/08/2017
Total Items: Five New generic brand skateboard wheels w/ bearings

Input: One green wheel
Setting: Rough
Output: A few chunks of unformed green rubber and plastic, as well as a small pile of steel dust.

Input: One green wheel
Setting: Coarse
Output: Disassembled green skateboard wheel. Appears to have been used heavily and shows scuff marks and discoloration.

Input: One green wheel
Setting: 1:1
Output: One red wheel of identical make and quality.

Input: One green wheel
Setting: Fine
Output: One unmarked black wheel of almost perfect quality. The outer rubber of the wheels greatly resists wear even with prolonged use, and the center bearing exhibits almost no friction, and was successfully left spinning in a vacuum sealed environment for just under ██ days.

Input: One green wheel
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One bearing, suspended by an invisible outer wheel of unknown material. Although invisible, the outer wheel physically exists and appears to use higher-dimensional translations to redirect the force of gravity and propel the object forward at at about half the speed of free fall. The wheel can be easily stopped at low speeds, but gains momentum quickly while unhindered. Prospective researchers should note that under the influence of gravity the wheel will always retain a 1/4mg horizontal force, even while at rest.

Note: And they say you can't reinvent the wheel. - Dr. Collins
Addendum: Following the collision of a Class-D personnel with Dr. ████ at ██ mph, all human testing has been suspended until Dr. ████ can come up with proper testing procedures.

Test 914-0156
Name: Dr. Hadiane
Date: 19/08/2017
Total Items: Three collections of children's toys made from magnets and ball bearings

Input: One magnet and bearing set
Setting: 1:1
Output: A collection of interlocking plastic rods. The tips of each are magnetised.

Input: One magnet and bearing set
Setting: Fine
Output: A series of magnetic rods and metal balls that appear to be self-replicating and self-assembling. Current structure is a pyramid roughly half a meter wide and tall. This structure shows no other anomalous properties and has been safely contained.

Input: One magnet and bearing set
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A fine metal dust that exhibits similar properties to the "Fine" result, appearing to resolve itself into crystalline structure. It can be safely molded by hand, with the rough consistency of hot wax, and can be pulled apart without much effort. Class-D personnel who touched the substance barehanded reported a feeling of delight, and continued to play with it even as it encased their hands. Subjects were pulled away without injury and the substance has been contained.

Note: Well, it certainly seems like a fun little toy to play with, but I'm fairly certain this isn't safe by any metric. - Dr. Hadian

Test 914-0157
Name: Dr. C. Ahearna
Date: 21/08/2017
Total Items: Three Samsung Galaxy phones

Input: One Samsung Galaxy phone.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One Apple iPhone.

Input: One Samsung Galaxy phone.
Setting: Fine
Output: A cell phone of unknown make or model, still using the same Android Operating System as before. The device seems to have the capability to use cellular data even while out of range of any cell towers. More testing is required.

Input: One Samsung Galaxy phone.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A black, malleable circular disk with a single button on the back. Pressing the button causes a hologram to begin projecting from a small LED-like device on the front. The hologram functions as an operating system for the device, which like the output produced by the Fine setting never loses cellular service. More testing is required.

Note: I think we should reverse engineer the holographic phone produced by the Very Fine test, it could potentially be an amazing business opportunity if we can figure out how to reproduce it. - Dr. Ahearna

Test 914-0158
Name: Dr. Greer
Date: 30/08/2017
Total Items: Five blank keycards, not loaded with cryptographical access codes. Intended to be used by technicians to test new card readers.

Input: One keycard
Setting: Rough
Output: A small pile of ground PVC plastic and approximately half a gram (0.5g) of magnetic composite material.

Input: One keycard
Setting: Coarse
Output: One blank keycard, cut in half.

Input: One keycard
Setting:1:1
Output: One SCP Foundation identification card. The card appeared to belong to "John Doe" and was filled out with similar generic information.

Input: One keycard
Setting: Fine
Output: One clearance level five keycard. The card was demagnetized and discarded.

Input: One keycard
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One keycard, belonging to a nonexistent company, "Arwachenzelli". Upon insertion into a keycard reader, it will cause an immediate short-circuit.

Test 914-0159
Name: Dr. Mason
Date: 07/09/2017
Total Items: Five real-time location beacons, standard Foundation issue.
Note: The area above and around SCP-914 was set with receivers before this test. In this test, all directional notation is relative to the central "Intake" and "Output" booths, i.e., a subject standing at the mainspring is facing "North".

Input: One tracking beacon
Setting: Rough
Output: Small amounts of various scrap metals and other composite materials of tracking beacons.
Path: Within the first 0.15 seconds, the signal was traced to move 3.41 meters "North" before turning exactly 91 degrees. Signal was lost after another 0.3 meters.

Input: One tracking beacon
Setting: Coarse
Output: One tracking beacon, with battery and transceiver unit removed. No other visible damage.
Path: While again initially traveling "North" for 3.41 meters, the tracking device remained functional for almost twice the amount of time as the first trial. This path appeared to follow the outer edges of the rectangular main body of SCP 914 before the signal was lost.
Note: I wonder if there are set paths that each setting follows. - Dr. Mason

Input: One tracking beacon
Setting: 1:1
Output: One unlabeled tracking beacon consistent with those used by Canadian counter-terrorist groups.
Path: "North" for 3.41 meters. Signal then moves towards one of the "Southwestern" outer segments of SCP-914, where it repeatedly follows an equilateral triangle for 0.13 seconds before losing signal. Analysis of received signals shows a new signal retracing a path back to the booths.
Note: Seriously, though. What is that first bit Northward for? I've checked the recordings, it does that in every test. Every. Single. One. - Dr. Mason

Input: One tracking beacon
Setting: Fine
Output: One apparent tracking beacon, components consistent with Foundation-specific requirements. Tracking beacon is smaller than standard, with certain unknown components. Testing revealed it to be fully operational, although signal was lost mid-test, as the output ran a different operating system.
Path: "North" for 3.63 meters. "South-southeast" for 0.7 meters. Accelerates in the opposite direction for four meters before signal cutoff.
Note: So, I was talking to a colleague about my testing, and they said that the Fine output sounded familiar. Turns out the smaller beacon and the new OS are both prototypes right now. Guess we end up using them. - Dr. Mason

Input: One tracking beacon
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One thin strip of translucent film, shown to be attachable with static cling. Discovered to be remarkable resilient for its size when D-1126 tore a fingernail pulling it off of the wall of the Output Booth. Currently unreadable.
Path: "North" for 3.41 meters. Subsequently appears to reach all parts of SCP-914, although high speeds prevented receivers from accurately tracking the path.
Note 1: Well, that was disappointing. At least I got a strip of fancy tape. Hopefully I'll be able to get something out of the prior results. - Dr. Mason
Note 2: So, turns out if you let that tape stick itself to your hand, you can draw the paths of whatever it recorded. You also draw a legend, and what appears to be a menu screen. I'm going to try to get this put onto a D-Class to preserve my wrists. - Dr. Mason
Note 3: Wow. So, not only did the new tracker record its own movements, it somehow recorded ALL of the movements. Of EVERYTHING that 914 has worked on over the last three months. I think I've finally gotten 914 to work with us, albeit with a lot of analysis involved. This is amazing. - Dr. Mason
Note 4: [EXPLETIVE DELETED]. I thought it would make sense for ONCE. But no, it had to be messing with us again. One of my interns - sorry, Junior Researchers - found out that, if you superimpose all the paths from the tracker, you get a 3D image of the Foundation logo. It's pretty for art drawn in GPS, but it still makes this whole project meaningless. Piece of [EXPLETIVE DELETED] doesn't follow set paths. It does whatever it wants. - Dr. Mason
Note 5: Dr. Mason has been placed on psychological leave due to apparent stress. Junior Researcher Chen has taken over. Analysis of the object paths taken will continue. - O5 Command

Test 914-0160
Name: Dr. Praetorious
Date: 15/09/2017
Total Items: Five promotional Audio Compact Discs, “Banana Pancakes” by Jack Johnson

Input: One Disc
Setting: Rough
Output: Shredded multi-colored reflective polycarbonate plastic coated with aluminum.

Input: One Disc
Setting: Coarse
Output: Pools of yellow and black ink (most likely from label), aluminum and polycarbonate plastic pellets.

Input: One Disc
Setting: 1:1
Output: One Audio compact disc, “Ain't No Reason” by Brett Dennen

Input: One Disc
Setting: Fine
Output: One Apparently unchanged compact disc. However when played for D-class personnel, they commented on the superior quality of the music and a lasting preference for Jack Johnson’s singing, requesting more of his works (measurement of the duration of musical preference in progress).

Input: One Disc
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One Apparently unchanged compact disc. However when played for D-class personnel, test subjects mentioned tasting maple syrup and bananas, additionally had a feeling of fullness afterwards. They declined offers of food for a period of 4 hours afterwards, and blood tests immediately after the experiment indicated the consumption of a high carbohydrate meal, even though no food had been consumed by the subjects for 6 hours previously. No other anomalous effects were reported.

Note: Interesting results. Let’s see what happens with a different CD. - Dr. ██████

Total Items: Five Audio Compact Discs, “Toxic” by Britney Spears

Input: One Disc
Setting: Rough
Output: Shredded multi-colored reflective polycarbonate plastic, coated with aluminum.

Input: One Disc
Setting: Coarse
Output: Pools of black and red ink (most likely from label), aluminum and polycarbonate plastic pellets.

Input: One Disc
Setting: 1:1
Output: One Audio compact disc, “Beautiful” by Christina Aguilera

Input: One Disc
Setting: Fine
Output: One apparently unchanged compact disc. However when played for D-class personnel, they commented on the extreme skill of the singing. Subsequently stomach pains and nausea were reported. Anomalous effects continued for approximately 36 hours after the test.

Input: One Disc
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One apparently unchanged compact disc. However when played for D-class personnel, an immediate euphoric effect was noted, with certain individuals weeping with emotion and others falling over with apparent rictus smiles on their face. Soon after the effects were noted additional symptoms were exhibited, including seizures, jaundice, and vomiting. The experiment was immediately ended, however researcher A-1 ████ was injured by D-17645 while attempting to turn off the disc player, begging the researcher to allow him to continue listening to the music.

Security proceeded to restrain the remaining ambulatory D-class personnel long enough for ██████ to deactivate the player. Physical examinations and testing of the individuals exposed to the music revealed the presence of a previously unknown euphoric-inducing toxin in their bloodstreams. Chelation was performed, but one individual expired from a combination of kidney failure, liver failure, and cardiac necrosis.

Note: Let’s try and avoid any more CDs that might be interpreted as "dangerous". It might be a good idea to just get a Lawrence Welk single and see if people get drunk. - Dr. ██████

Test 914-0162
Name: Dr. P

Date: 11/10/2017
Total Items: One Remington 870 shotgun (no bullets chambered), fifteen 9mm bullets, and one Beretta M9 handgun.

Input: One Remington 870 shotgun
Setting: Fine
Output: One Mossberg pump shotgun. When fired, acted normal for a mossberg and was discarded to the armory locker after testing and no other anomalies were found to be present.

Input: Fifteen 9 millimeter bullets
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Nine millimeter bullets that when fired from a Beretta M9 handgun home to the nearest signs of life. In the event of testing, a security guard was hit and killed. The cause of death was not from a wound, but from cardiac arrest. The bullets were discarded.

Note: I'm not sure if the bullets should be used as actual ammunition as they pose a huge threat to other personnel. I'm requesting that testing of bullets on very fine is prohibited. - Dr. Dextrainia

Note: Granted. - O5-7

Test 914-0164
Name: Dr. Simonson
Date: 12/10/2017
Total Items: Three jars of crude oil

Input: One jar of crude oil.
Setting: Rough
Output: One jar of solid asphalt.

Note: The jar was unharmed, strangely. - Dr. Simonson

Input: One jar of crude oil.
Setting: Fine
Output: One jar of gasoline.

Input: One jar of crude oil.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One jar of LPG. Aforementioned gas quickly escaped after opening the “output” door.

Note: I probably should’ve sealed it. - Dr. Simonson

Test 914-0165
Name: Dr. Reece
Date: 13/10/2017
Total Items: Five generic gum balls, assorted colors, commonly found in grocery store $.25 candy dispensers.

Input: One purple gum ball
Setting: Rough
Output: Melted puddle of gum, separate puddle of purple food coloring.

Input: One red gum ball
Setting: Coarse
Output: Separate piles of dextrose, corn syrup, gum base, corn starch, and red food dyes.

Input: One green gum ball
Setting: 1:1
Output: One everlasting gobstopper.

Input: One blue gum ball
Setting: Fine
Output: One blue gum ball. Outer shell was a much glossier blue than input gum ball. When chewed, subject reported that the flavor was that of farm ripened blueberries.

Input: One yellow gum ball
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One shiny yellow gum ball. Gum appears to glow faintly in low light. Testing indicates no source for this glow. When chewed, subject reported feelings of euphoria. Subject indicated that the gum reminded them of their favorite childhood meal, but couldn't elaborate as to what the flavor actually was. Flavor apparently does not fade away as with normal chewing gum.

Note: The everlasting flavor seems to be further indication that this thing modifies objects based on our perception of them. Everyone wishes gum would keep its flavor for more than a few minutes. - Dr. Reece

Test 914-0166
Name: Dr. Simonson
Date: 23/10/2017
Total items: Three ordinary keys from the lost-and-found room.

Input: One key

Setting: Coarse
Output: A pile of unrefined wool.

Input: One wool blanket
Setting: 1:1
Output: A cotton blanket of identical mass and thickness.

Input: One wool blanket
Setting: Very fine
Output: An extremely light-absorbent blanket made out of an unidentified material. When given to D-class personnel, feeling was described as "extremely comfortable."

Note: I'm going to be taking this one home for some extra… research. Yeah. - Dr. Ashwood

Note: Rumours have circulated around the building that Dr. Ashwood was seen cuddling with her blanket several hours after testing in the mess hall. Reminder that it is very unprofessional to spread rumours about other personnel.

Input: One 10 kg ingot of copper, one 10 kg ingot of tin, one 500 g block of wood, one 100 g spool of cloth, one photograph of SCP-914
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One miniature model of SCP-914 weighing the same as all input materials, including the photograph. The model possesses all features of the original, including complex miniaturized clockwork, intake booths and a miniature setting knob and mainspring key.

The miniature model was tested to determine if it functioned similarly to SCP-914.

Input: One 50 g nugget of copper, one 50 g nugget of tin, 2.5 g of wood, a 0.5 g patch of cloth, one photograph of SCP-914
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One even smaller model of SCP-914 weighing the same as all input materials, including the photograph. The model possesses all features of the original, including complex miniaturized clockwork, intake booths and a miniature setting knob and mainspring key.

Note: It's SCP-914 all the way down. - Researcher █████████

Test 914-0170
Name: Dr. Hadian
Date: 18/12/2017
Total Items: One roll of yarn and one porcelain teapot, full

Input: The above items
Setting: Fine
Output: One teapot, still porcelain, of the same make as the input; however, it was filled with a viscous, multi-colored fluid. Additionally, the yarn was replaced with a length of brown string, that has a vaguely earthy scent to it. Further testing shows the teapot's contents to be chemically similar to organic fibers, particularly those found on the coats of several subspecies of sheep, while the string appears to be made from the remains of a plant of the family theaceae.

Note: How did it even do that? - Dr. Hadian

Test 914-0171
Name: Dr. Obs

The human dishes are in described in French, the alien dishes are described in an unknown language using the International Phonetic Alphabet.

Note: Who set this thing to Fine?! …Well, at least we now know how to cater to the aliens, and what their food is called. - Mellows

Tests 45-49 omitted

Input: One English-Russian Dictionary
Setting: 1:1
Output: One Braille English-Pictogram Dictionary.

Note: We got a limited understanding of alien food and not much else. I'll need to rethink my strategy here. - Mellows

Total Items: Five IMI Desert Eagles chambered in .50AE, unloaded.

Input: One IMI Desert Eagle .50AE
Setting: Rough
Output: Approx. 4.4 lb of metal chunks. Consists with the weight of one such Desert Eagle.

Input: One IMI Desert Eagle .50AE
Setting: Coarse
Output: One fully disassembled Desert Eagle, each component sorted based on size.

Input: One IMI Desert Eagle .50AE
Setting: 1:1
Output: One IWI Jericho 941.
Note: The Jericho is a pistol also designed and manufactured by IMI with cosmetic similarities to the Desert Eagle.

Input: One IMI Desert Eagle .50AE
Setting: Fine
Output: A small cannon, weighing 4.4 lb. The back is capable of being opened up to load one .50AE round. A small trigger is located on the top of the cannon.

Note: This brings a whole new meaning to a hand-cannon. Will place output in the site armory. - Dr. J P█████

Input: One IMI Desert Eagle .50AE
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A small clockwork bird, appearance similar to that of a bald eagle. It appears to behave similar to an actual bald eagle, except far more docile.

Note: I don't know what I was expecting, but a clockwork bird was not even a possibility I thought of. On occasion, the bird seems to make varying pitch clicking in some form of melodic pattern. - Dr. J P█████

Update: It dawned on me that the pattern of notes it plays is to that of the American national anthem, "Star-Spangled Banner." I'm keeping it and naming it Kennedy. - Dr. J P█████

Test 914-0176
Name: Dr. Hadian
Date: 17/02/2018
Total Items: One printed copy of a Javascript program (created by Dr. Hadian for recreational purposes).

Input: The aforementioned manuscript
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A series of origami cranes that took off as soon as the chamber was open, flying in irregular patterns. Most of the cranes collided with the doorway and fell straight to the ground, exhibiting no further anomalous properties.

Note: The program input was an application similar to the app "Flappy Bird".

Note: That was interesting. I'll have to see about something a little more complex. - Dr. Hadian

Test 914-0177
Name: Dr. Hadian
Date: 17/02/2018
Total Items: One printed copy of a Javascript program (meant to be a "chat bot")

Input: The aforementioned manuscript
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A small paper-mache head that spoke in a choppy, occasionally non-sequitur fashion. In spite of its ability to communicate, the head appears to lack true sentience, instead repeating back phrases taught to it and a few other basic English sentences.

Note: About what I expected. I could be mistaken, but it would appear that even though SCP 914 is a mechanical device, machine code is still somehow understood by it. This would make sense, with the interpretation that it functions based on the "meaning" of objects, and given the explicit functionality of most programming languages, we might be able to achieve more stable results this way. - Dr. Hadian

Test 914-0178
Name: Researcher Mikk
Date: 21/02/2018
Total Items: One printed copy of a Javascript program (self-learning chat bot), five kilograms of tin with 5% silver, 10 grams of copper, 500 grams of plastic

Note: This is a continuation of the tests of Dr. Hadian. - Researcher Mikk

Input: One printed copy of a Javascript program (self-learning chat bot), five kilograms of stainless steel, 10 grams of copper, 500 grams of plastic
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Same as the last time, but made of stainless steel. The voice was similar to the chatbot "Evie." When connected to a computer using an USB cable, it will start speaking to you similarly to the chatbot "Cleverbot." Further test logs awaiting O5 approval.

Note: The head is supposedly "sentient," according to the people who first talked to it, which could be wrong, because the program code was simple and when used in a normal computer, is not sentient.

Test 914-0179
Name: Dr. Hadian
Date: 22/02/2018
Total Items: One manuscript of a simple Javascript program, one fluorescent light bulb.

Note: The code in question was a program devised to have the bulb turn on if it was being held right-side up. This test is to see if SCP 914 will comply in fabricating such an object.

Input: The aforementioned materials
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A luminescent mass, opaque, with a smoky white color. The object could be moved without difficulty, but it would not rotate in any fashion except in a way that kept it perpendicular to the floor. In all attempts to defy this property, it has proven immobile, causing the tester's hand to slip, defying gravity, and in one case, shattering the shaft of a power tool rigged to turn it over.

Note: We'll chalk that one up as "inconclusive". Certainly an interesting paperweight, though. -Dr. Hadian

Test 914-0180
Name: Dr. Sato
Date: 24/02/2018
Total Items: One unloaded electric airsoft M16 Rifle

Input: One unloaded electric airsoft M16 Rifle
Setting: 1:1
Output: One Pull-action crossbow with a hollow stock, three carbon fiber bolts with an electronic device serving as a bolt head.

Note: The mass of the bolts was equal to that of the original gun’s stock, which appeared to be made of carbon fiber. Researcher suspects that the device serves as a tracker but has no means of confirming it without potentially compromising the product.

Input: One of said carbon fiber bolts
Setting: Fine
Output: A single construction bolt with some sort of mechanism on it.

Note: Experimentation has revealed that the bolt is self screwing, using what is likely a small motor. The self screwing takes effect after light manual labor is applied.

Test 914-0181
Name: Dr. Hertz
Date: 28/02/2018
Total Items: Four assorted recordable compact-discs (CD-Rs) containing music samples

Input: One CD-R, containing a recording of Creedence Clearwater Revival's Fortunate Son (1969)
Setting: Rough
Output: One CD-R, containing a recording of Fortunate Son, later identified as being covered by The Shaggs, a 1960's rock band known for terrible performances. Notably, The Shaggs were not known to have ever performed this song.

Input: One CD-R, containing a recording of Neil Diamond's I'm a Believer (1967).
Setting: 1:1
Output: One CD-R, containing a recording of The Monkees' I'm a Believer (1967).

Input: One CD-R, containing a recording of the █████████ High School (located in ██████, ██) Class of ████ student orchestra performing Pachelbel's Canon in D.
Setting: Fine
Output: One CD-R, containing a professional orchestral rendition of Pachelbel's Canon in D. The performers were later identified as the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra.

Note: Dr. Hertz was noted to appear giddy and excited upon discovery of this result.

Input: One copy of Aeolian Memories, a self-published album of 21 songs composed, written, performed on guitar, and sung by Dr. Hertz in his spare time while moonlighting as a musical artist.
Setting: Very fine
Output: One CD-R. Upon further inspection, the music had been replaced with five tracks of complete silence, followed by the first chapters of the audiobooks Learn to Sing 101 by Karen Surmani, Teach Yourself to Play Guitar by David Brewster, and Songwriting for Dummies by Dave Austin, et al.

Note: At this point, Dr. Hertz was restrained and firmly escorted out of Research Cell 109-B for attempting to damage SCP-914 and yelling about "the [EXPLETIVE] what thinks it's being [EXPLETIVE] funny!" He has been temporarily suspended from the SCP-914 research program for unprofessional behavior.

Date: 10/03/2018
Total Items: One manuscript of a Javascript program (self-learning chatbot), one manuscript of a Javascript program (Convolutional Neural Network model), one mechanical pocket watch, one photo of a bird (Pica sericea).

Note: The previous tests done with mechanical parts and code sections by Dr. Hadian and Researcher Mikk intrigued me. - Dr. Rook

Input: One manuscript of a Javascript program (self-learning chatbot), one manuscript of a Javascript program (Convolutional Neural Network model), one mechanical aluminum & silver pocket watch, one USB, one photo of a bird (Pica sericea).
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A mechanical bird roughly the size of a large pocket watch. Resembled a Korean Magpie in shape. The bird seemed to be made with a mix of clockwork and realistic metal plumage. By some unknown mechanism, it could hover for brief periods (roughly 45 seconds) in the air, though its base material- aluminum and silver- should’ve prohibited it from doing so. It could not speak in this form, though it displayed considerable intelligence and responded to people speaking to it. When connected to a computer via USB cable, the bird was able to speak through the computer’s speakers. It was capable of speech comparable to an eight-year-old child’s, though speech patterns significantly improved after several conversations. It acted remarkably similarly to a live magpie. Other than the mechanical bird, three folded sheets of blank paper were found in the output chamber. Close analysis revealed that they had no anomalous properties. Placed in item storage.

Note: I’m keeping the bird for some more research into how 914 could be used to create automated objects. One of the first tests recorded included a clockwork bird, so that’s where this came from. Dr. Hadrian was right! Think of the possibilities! - Dr. Rook.

Note: No matter how much Dr. Rook's 'Robbie' resembles a young child during communication, the result of this test has not yet been verified to be fully sentient.

Test 914-0183
Name: Dr. Joe
Date: 13/03/2018
Total Items: Three White Paper origami swans weighing 29g each.

Input: One Paper swan
Setting: Rough
Output: One Crumpled piece of white paper weighing 29g

Input: One Paper Swan
Setting: 1:1
Output: One Paper "fortune teller" popular with young schoolchildren with no writing on it weighing 29g.

Input: One Paper Swan
Setting: Fine
Output: One paper model of Cygnus buccinator (trumpeter swan) the size and mass of the original Origami swan. However this model is entirely anatomically correct to Cygnus buccinator in every way, with some organ systems being made of seemingly impossibly thin layers of paper. The model displays no anomalous properties.

Note: Interesting. 914 created a model of my personal favorite species of swan from the original paper one. Sentience or coincidence? I need to do more tests, but first make sure that model is saved in Fragile Non-Anomalous Item Storage, it could be useful at a later date. - Dr. Joe

Test 914-0184
Name: Dr. O’Bryan
Date: 25/03/2018
Total Items: Three different pieces of communication on paper medium.

Input: One typed thesis, titled “An Experimental Study on the Stress Limits of Metals in Corrosive Liquids”, as submitted by D-914-29.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One typed thesis, titled “A Complete Experimental Study on the Stress Limits of Metals in Various Environments”. A review of the output by the subject and subsequently studied by appropriate personnel revealed no anomalous properties. The output contains research on several experiments not included in the original input, with suggestions on how to vastly improve the strength of metals in a wide variety of situations. A review of the output is being conducted by the Facilities and Engineering Department to test to see if these findings can improve security within the Foundation.

Input: One page of sheet music from “Ellen’s Third Song” by Schubert, as submitted by D-914-86.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Tiny (5cm x 5cm x 2cm) origami music box. Upon opening the box, a clear melody identified as the song “Ellen’s Third Song” could be heard by all researchers in the area facility, including those who should be well out of range of being able to hear. Subject D-914-86 began singing along with the music, despite not showing any previous indication of knowing either Latin or taking singing lessons. After the conclusion of the piece, subsequent experiments confirmed that she could not sing.

Input: One copy of “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie, as submitted by D-914-77.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One slightly warmer copy of “How to Win Friends and Influence People”. D-914-77 was sent back to their cell and monitored, showing no anomalous behavior after a week of review.

Note: D-914-77, and two guards have been reported as missing. Security footage shows the guards opening several doors and escorting D-914-77 off the premises, and driving them to a nearby restaurant. When a security team was sent there to retrieve the subject, a conflict began between the patrons of the restaurant and the security team, with the patrons refusing to allow the security team close to D-914-77. An order was given with O4 clearance to destroy the location, as a possible memetic anomaly may have occurred. Although the remains of D-914-77 have not been positively identified, security footage suggests that no one escaped the building prior to its demolition. Local media have been alerted to the fact that the destruction was caused by a broken gas main in the restaurant's kitchen.

Note: A full memetic screening will be made whenever media provided by SCP-914 is consumed. Please refer to Incident Report 914-IR6187 for further details.

Test 914-0185
Name: Dr. Manheim
Date: 25/03/2018
Total Items: One USB drive with a text file containing the source code of Creeper.

Note: Creeper was one of the first computer viruses ever made, and the systems it operated on are now 100% obsolete. Organic materials have been intentionally omitted from this test, in case SCP-914 decides to translate that into an actual biological virus. A hazardous materials team was on standby to make sure nothing that came out of 914 presented a threat to the facility or its occupants.

Input: Creeper source code on USB drive.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A metallic figure, green in color and vaguely phallic. The object self-destructed upon being removed from SCP-914, in a manner comparable to a commercial firework. The remains have shown no anomalous properties.

Note: Well, that was anticlimactic. - Dr. Manheim

Test 914-0189
Name: Researcher M. Inselmann
Date: 25/03/2018
Total Items: Three copies of 'Mein Kampf,' by Adolf Hitler. Text in the original German.

Input: A copy of Mein Kampf
Setting: 1:1
Output: A book titled 'How to Make Friends, Influence People, and then Murder Them,' subtitled 'How to be a Dickhead for Dummies.' Text mostly consists of hyperbolic German profanity.

Input: A copy of Mein Kampf
Setting: Fine
Output: A pile of ashes.

Input: A copy of Mein Kampf
Setting: Very Fine
Output: An animate 45-centimeter tall origami caricature of Adolf Hitler. Object does not appear to be sapient, but is able to vocalize a non-stop stream of threats and boasts. Voice confirmed to be that of the original Adolf Hitler. Object also noted to often clumsily fall over or bump into walls while goose-stepping about. Object is harmless, and mildly regenerative (the origami will refold if disrupted), and can be kicked by researchers as a form of stress management at their discretion.

Note: Outside of the testing area please. I should not need to specify that. - Dr. Veritas

Input: One 2-cavity klystron power amplifier.
Setting: Fine
Output: A device comprised of complex structure within presumably a resonating cavity, along with an electron source and output port on opposite side of each other. A flawed judgement of the device's structural integrity leads to the partial destruction of the device due to mishandling. The function or the capability of the device remains unknown.

Input: One 2-cavity klystron power amplifier.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One ornate reflex klystron oscillator. The size of the device is noticeably smaller than original input. The device is adorned with unusual amount of ornament, depicting patterns consistent with GOI-004C ("Maxwellist's Church") iconography. Power output and bandwidth of the device remains within original specification.

Test 914-0196
Name: Prof. Snider
Date: 26/04/2018
Total Items: Five 500mL samples of SCP-999's slime.

Note: SCP-999 was at first eager to donate samples when asked, although it was visibly nervous when presented with a syringe, requiring gentle reassurance and calming before cooperating. Samples were extracted successfully without further incident, though whether or not SCP-999 feels pain is still unknown.

Input: 500mL sample of SCP-999, poured directly into input chamber
Setting: Rough
Output: Cloud of orange-colored gas, which quickly dissipated into the air. No harmful effects were found, though Prof. Snider noted it "smelled like burning hair".

Input: 500mL sample of SCP-999
Setting: Coarse
Output: Pile of waxy, crystalline orange granules with a mild orange scent. Chemical analysis identified it as flavored sucrose, A.K.A. rock candy. When tasted, granules were found to have an extremely unpleasant flavor described as "overwhelmingly, disgustingly sweet with an alcohol-like undertaste".

Input: 500mL sample of SCP-999
Setting: 1:1
Output: 500mL of orange liquid with the viscosity of water. Extremely greasy to the touch, became sticky when dried. Smelled mildly of peanuts.

Input: 500mL sample of SCP-999
Setting: Fine
Output: A frozen block of SCP-999 slime. Attempting to melt back to liquid form resulted in a pile of orange sludge much thicker and more adhesive than before. Further heating resulted in discovering its napalm-like qualities.

Input: 500mL sample of SCP-999
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A small, spherical blob of translucent, azure-colored slime roughly 12cm in diameter, with a strong garlic-like odor. Found to be mobile and sentient, and capable of making gurgling, chirping vocalizations similar to SCP-999 but at a much deeper pitch. The entity, designated "E-999-A", was immediately hostile to all staff, attempting to either leap upon researchers' faces or "headbutt" their shins via rolling across the floor at high speed, though its small size and mass prevented it from doing more than mild bruising.

Addendum: E-999-A was eventually contained and presented to SCP-999, with the assumption that this was its "offspring", and that SCP-999 could teach it to become more docile. SCP-999 instead reacted with immediate hostility, attacking E-999-A with its pseudopods while E-999-A rolled around SCP-999, emitting loud "growling" and "snarling" noises while dodging. SCP-999 finally eliminated E-999-A roughly two minutes later via engulfing it with two pseudopods, rapidly dissolving E-999-A inside its body similar to how SCP-999 digests its meals.

No change in SCP-999's color or demeanor following the incident has been noted, however, it is the first and thus far only time that SCP-999 has ever reacted to anything with hostility or violence. Mentioning E-999-A to SCP-999 results in it immediately "ignoring" whoever speaks to it, often by wandering off to play with a nearby object or person. Further research involving SCP-999's slime is temporarily suspended save for researchers with at least Level 3 clearance, and any experiments involving SCP-999 and SCP-914 are completely prohibited.

Note: Prof. Snider is currently facing disciplinary action due to violation of biological safety protocol. The next one I catch is losing their clearance indefinitely. - Dr. Veritas

Input: Dr. Naismith’s credit card
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A similar credit card covered with a series of unidentified corporate insignias and the phrase “RANK-ALEPH INFINITE MONEY PRIVILEGES.”

Note: Dr. Naismith, I didn’t think I need to remind you that SCP-914 is not to be used for personal financial gain, but it seems I was wrong. Consider this an official warning. -Dr. Coltrane

Input: A printout of the above note from Dr. Coltrane
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A printout of a note reading “Dr. Naismith, I didn’t even think of using SCP-914 for personal financial gain, but that seems like a solid idea. Consider this official permission to reap the fruits of your labor. -O5-11”

Total Items: Two 2048 Qubit QPUs (Quantum Processing Unit) manufactured by D-Wave Systems.

Input: One QPU
Setting: 1:1
Output: One 2048 bead abacus constructed from silicon, aluminum, and ceramic.
The beads are arranged in four columns of ten rows, with thirty-two silicon beads in each cell.
When a bead in one cell is moved, a random assortment of other beads will move as well. No distinct pattern has been found in these movements.

Input: One QPU
Setting: Fine
Output: One 2048 QPU with "Output (Binary)" and "Output (Analog)" printed on the top left and right corners of the chip, "Input (Binary)" and "Input (Analog)" printed on the bottom left and right corners of the chip.
The binary input channel only accepts data in the form of digital signals like document files, audio files, network data, and computer programs. The analog input channel only accepts direct signals from radio, voltage, microphones, and signal generators.
The new QPU appears to convert input data in a similar way to SCP-914 in the "1:1" setting. Only one input channel will accept data at a time, the corresponding output channel will output data as a digital signal (file, network-stream, or data-stream) or an analog signal (audio signal, waveform, or radio wave).

Input: One audio recorder
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One device with the same exterior form as a Foundation standard issue clandestine audio recorder. The device functions as a regular foundation recorder, but instead of recording local audio, the device records a random, currently ongoing, conversation between two or more people. No distance limit to this effect has been found. The device is currently used as a global monitoring tool.

Test 914-0207
Name: Dr. C. Jung, Research assistant A.Y. Lichko
Date: 30/04/2018
Total Items: Five Foundation Class C Amnestic Injectors

Input: One (injector)
Setting: Rough
Output: A small metal cube (aluminium), a pile of white powder (████████████-██████-█████████, the active ingredient for amnestics), and a puddle of liquid that ignited into a blue flame upon touch (presumed to be the inactive carrier fluid)

Input: One (injector)
Setting: Coarse
Output: One disassembled injector and a cloud of ████████████-██████-█████████ in gaseous form.

Note: Assistant was brought back up to speed regarding the tests with SCP-914 after a short rest. - Jung

Input: One (injector)
Setting: 1:1
Output: One decorative aluminium floral brooch (Catharanthus roseus) the scent of which causes the subject to lose all recollection of events preceding for at least one day. This "scent" is immeasurable and undetectable by anything other than humans and only works at a close range, about 50 cm.

Note: Assistant Lichko has been given a hazmat suit for future testing - Jung

Input: One (injector)
Setting: Fine
Output: One Foundation Class C Amnestic Injector. The object is mostly unchanged except for the two rotary dials that have been added to the bottom of the injector. The dials appear to indicate an exact range of recollection to erase (scaling between 1 minute and 30 days).

Input: One (injector)
Setting: Very fine
Output: [REDACTED]

Note: This object, if it even is an object, is a cognitohazard. It erases all of the subject's memory when it views the item. A cognitohazard containment team has removed it from SCP-914's output chamber. Research assistant A.Y. Lichko has been transferred to the infirmary. - Jung

Test 914-0208
Name: Dr Lachlan O’Hehir, Lieutenant Rueben GreenTree
Date: 30/04/2018
Total Items: 3 Pairs of 3D glasses (Glasses are polarised 3D glasses, which is the design that modern cinemas use)

Input: One pair of 3D glasses
Setting: 1:1
Output: One pair of 3D glasses, except with a brand logo on the side (Samsung), still works as expected with minor differences in colour (compared to original)

Input: One pair of 3D glasses
Setting: Fine
Output: One pair of 3D glasses with no obvious difference, when put on, however, the viewer sees any 2D image as a 3D image and sees the 3D world with a more stretched field of view.

Note: Using the 3D glasses in the already 3D world has no use, it just makes things look marginally further away than where they should be.

Input: One pair of 3D glasses
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One mask with lenses over the eyes, when put on the lenses redirect to align themselves with the viewers eyes, the viewer experiences the world with an added dimension, 2D objects like shadows or pictures become 3D, 3D objects irregulate and create a second version of themselves, within themselves, resulting in interior and exterior shadowing. Objects will grow a 4th dimension, rather than adding onto the (X,Y,Z) axis, the glasses merge a second (X,Y,Z) Axis into the original, the 2 merged axis create 1 bigger axis of (X,X,Y,Z,Z). The second Y Axis is merged with the original, (although any 2 axis can merge). This resulted in many Class D’s who were tested on to feel extreme nausea and headaches. One account that lasted over 15 minutes with the glasses on (average time is 3 minutes before the subject pulls out) said she saw sharp, paper thin objects that were piercing through solid matter. This is presumably 1D objects gaining depth.

Note: Items were put into storage as they may be of use in the future. - Dr. O’Hehir

Date: 05/05/2018
Total Items: Two pairs of standard UV protection sunglasses.

Input: One pair of sunglasses.
Setting: Rough.
Output: One tinted pane of glass Dimensions 50x50x3 mm. When pointed at a light and looked through, the pane generates extreme hallucinations from the light source. Such hallucinations have included "dragons and smoke monsters" to "birds with blue flaming wings and horns like a goat". Hallucinations vary from subject to subject and seem to have no correlation to the viewer's mental state or personality. When the pane is turned away from the source, the hallucinations immediately cease and "reset" until turned back to the light.

Note: ''Multiple D-class subjects have reported seeing a "Deer with enormous antlers and crazy floating orbs" when looking through the pane of glass. Investigation into a possible connection to SCP-2845 is underway."

Input: One pair of sunglasses.
Setting: 1:1
Output One pair of aviator style sunglasses with mirrored lenses. Memetic effects occur when a person views another individual wearing the sunglasses. Subjects will exclaim and persist that the glasses are the most “extremely stylish” and “hip” they have ever seen. Further testing is in order.

Note: Definitely the most sexy pair of sunglasses I’ve ever seen in my life. I have to keep them if I’m ever going to get a date - Researcher Blais

Note: Sure Blais, of course I'm going to let you keep an anomalous object for your personal gain. I stored it in the anomalous item wing for study. Don't ask where, I'm not telling you. - Dr. Veritas

Setting: 1:1
Output: One print-out describing knot-theory & one iron trefoil knot.

Note: The knot has no apparent seams or welding spots, this is beautifully made. - Cantor

Input: One print-out & one Sphere
Setting: Fine
Output: One collection of five intersecting tetrahedra forming an icosahedron with a paper origami woven between the tetrahedra to spell out one of the numbers 1 through 20 on each of the twenty icosahedrons faces. The "1" and "20" faces are inked completely black, the other numbers are white paper. Rolling the "D20" has no observable anomalous effects.

Note: 3 kilo something makes for a heavy D20. - Cantor
Note: We'll use it for special occasions. - Hausdorff

Input: One print-out & one Sphere
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One origami klein bottle inscribed with SCP-3669-2, function unknown, awaiting O5 approval for the creation of an SCP-3669-1 to discern the meaning of the inscriptions.
One or two iron sphere(s). It is unclear if the spheres are truly two separate objects, or one object simultaneously in multiple locations.
The "spheres" are solid only to matter that is not the other sphere, they "phase" through each other when they touch. The sum mass of the spheres when separate is 6 kilograms, when fully phased into each other the sum mass is 3 kilograms.

Note: I don't understand these arrows.. and why is the paper klein bottle shaped? - Cantor

Note: I'm still unsure if we've solved the Banach–Tarski paradox with these iron orbs, I do know that they are giving me a headache - Hausdorff

Input: 1 character sheet for the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons, 3.5th Edition, filled out by Researcher Thompson.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A sheet of paper promoting the non-existent tabletop roleplaying game Fear in the Foundation, 1st Edition. The paper repeatedly makes claims about the fun factor of the game but gives little information as to its actual content. Upon reading the entirety of the paper, subjects undergo an out-of-body experience in which they perceive themselves to exist in the game world. Based on subject’s reports, elements of the game are taken from several different tabletop roleplaying games. The game is also noted to contain several Foundation and SCP-related characters, items, and locations. Subjects will exit this state upon either dying in the game, or defeating the final villain.

Note: "I gave this a try, and ended up seeing SCP-096's face after rolling a 1 on stealth. If you don't hear from me within 5 minutes, I've blown my brains out." -Researcher Jacobson

Note: "Researcher Jacobson was later found dead in the anomalous item storage wing. Access to 'Fear in the Foundation' now requires supervision of at least one armed member of site security in case of visual hazards." —O5-6

Input: One digital thermometer.
Setting: Very fine.
Output: An intricate instrument with several digital dials that change when exposed to different temperatures and directions. One of the dials seemingly moves without purpose. The symbols do not correspond to any known mathematical object to count or measure.

Note: Found out what the last dial did. It responds to minor changes in the orbital trajectory of Mercury. Mercury, like what we used in traditional thermometers. Hilarious. After four years of working with the damned thing, it's still taunting me. Carry on, people. The next person that takes out a part of the machine gets fed to the first thing with large teeth I can find. - Veritas.

Note: After some concerns raised, we should mention that Dr. Veritas is not authorized to feed his colleagues to anomalous objects. We do however, approve of his… request to refrain from using parts of SCP-914 in testing. - Site Director Hackett.

Current opening sequence is thirty-four steps.

Note: And I'm still not convinced we've actually managed to open it all the way. Though I'm pleasantly surprised at the amount of storage space in this thing. -Dr. Hadian

Test 914-0247
Name: Dr Sheldon
Date: 01/09/2018
Total Items: Eight candles each 15 centimetres in height and 1 centimetres in diameter, composed of wax and a cotton wick

Input: One of the aforementioned candles
Setting: Coarse
Output: A pile of carbon, cellulose, and hydrogen gas

Input: One of the aforementioned candles
Setting: Rough
Output: Thirty pieces of the candle each equivalent in size

Input: One of the aforementioned candles
Setting: Fine
Output: One candle, seemingly identical to the input. Upon further testing, it was discovered to burn precisely forty times longer than it should have. The flame is steady and recordings with a high speed camera have shown no more than a millimeter variance of the flame’s dimensions. The light produced is in the 590 to 560 nanometer range, appearing yellow to the human eye.

Input: One of the aforementioned candles
Setting: Very fine
Output: Candle was modified into a ball of wax with a radius of ten centimeters. The surface, upon measuring with an electron microscope, was discovered to possess no flaws even at the nanometer resolution. Through further testing, it was determined that the “candle” will spontaneously ignite when the light in the immediate area around it dropped below the level required to discern colour. Upon ignition, the candle levitates to a height of two meters and stays there until the ambient light is sufficient for human eyes. The flame it produces lacks any heat and emits only light.

A second property of the sphere has been observed accidentally by a D-Class. Upon transporting it to a secure containment unit, the D-Class passed through the cryogenic containment units. The sudden drop in temperature caused the sphere to immediately ignite. The flame it produced in response to the sub-zero temperatures did not emit any light, but produced a flame with a temperature of 10,000 degrees Celsius. The D-Class was immediately killed by the extreme heat. Object is now in secure containment in a room with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius and ambient lighting of 200 lumen.

Input: One detective, stated above
Salting: 1:1
Output: Document was altered so that every word but one was a tire.

Note: The original document read as fennel: "This is a trust to see how 914 responds to 586. It will only be on 1:1, because other settings will arouse the paper itself too much. All we want to know is how 914 intercepts with the anomalous effects of 586. I surmise this will be fun." The output reality as follows: "Their it I trust two seed how 914 retribution so 586. Ill wit octopus blue no 1:1, before ether settings wall arouse throne pies Italy you macho. Apt wry woke yo know OS who 914 intercepts writhe thin anemone electric old 586.

Input: Chemotherapy bottle
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A pitch black bottle with no lid or label filled with ten pills all glowing an aura of unique colors. When swallowed, the subject's pupils change to the color of the pill. Approximately twenty hours after consumption, the subject will begin glowing on the skin of the same color as the pill consumed. An hour later, the subject slowly collapses into colored dust again resembling the color of the pill consumed. The dust has no recognizable chemical solution. Four pills were used in testing, one pill colored white mysteriously dissapeared while unwatched, and the remaining five pills are stored in the container in a standard containment locker. Awaiting classification if voted necessary.

Test 914-0253
Name: Dr. Flux
Date: 14/09/2018
Total Items: "Preserving the veil from the outside" - An educational pamphlet given to sapient objects in containment that have little to no understanding of The Foundation and the importance of it's mission.

Input: One of the aforementioned pamphlets.
Setting: 1:1
Output: "Mission RANGO LEPSIN FIFTY EIGHT" - A pamphlet directed at an unknown group of humanoid entities living in extra-dimensional space seemingly made by the Global Occult Coalition. Notably mentions something called "Euclid's Hammer" and threatens to activate it if the unknown entities ever attempt to reach Earth. The document explains "Euclid's Hammer" as a paratechnological device that reverts dimensional anomalies to normal space destroying everything inside.

Needless to say it is very concerning that the GOC has this. While The Foundation shouldn't necessarily control all paratech the GOC is very fond of weaponizing it which is frankly almost always a terrible fucking idea unless utterly necessary, and even then it's just because the alternative manages to be even worse. - Agent [REDACTED]

Input: One of the aforementioned pamphlets.
Setting: 1:1
Output: "Preserving the veil from the middle" - A pamphlet directed at Foundation containment maintenance staff explaining the importance of protecting sapient objects from outside forces.

SCP-914 does not show any notable bias in this document, indicating several possibilities. It is possible that SCP-914 simply does not have the emotional capability to care about it and other SCPs' status. While SCP-914 seems at times to be entertained by manipulating it's output it has never been noted to attempt communication meaning that it may only the ability to use output as "tools" rather than an information medium. SCP-914 may also just not understand communication on any level, assuming that it understands anything at all. A less likely but still worth noting possibility is that SCP-914's interests are aligned with The Foundation's. - Dr. █████ ██████

Input: One of the aforementioned pamphlets.
Setting: Fine
Output: Several pamphlets containing [DATA EXPUNGED] that when observed is intended to cause those who observe them to see nothing unethical on any level with The Foundation's practices. The hazards did not actually seem to work indicating that SCP-914 could not bypass [DATA EXPUNGED]. Further testing of this nature is advised against.

Input: One model solar system
Setting: 1:1
Output: No change the output model contains Pluto as well as the rest of the planets. Jupiter is noticeably smaller, presumably to account for the added mass.
Note: recently, debates began about Pluto’s position about a dwarf planet. It's interesting how SCP-914 picked up on it. -Dr. Anton.

Input: One model solar system
Setting: Fine
Output: A iron “core”, surrounded by several thousand tiny plastic spheres, suspended in the air via unknown means relative to the iron “core”, appearing as a Spiral Galaxy. Despite the levitation effects, the plastic’s weight still registers on a scale. Further analysis shows it is a model of the Andromeda Galaxy.

Input: One model solar system
Setting Very Fine
Output: An iron cube, with a plastic “lens”. The cube has several buttons on the side of it. The device operates without an external power source. It projects a hologram of any region of space the user wants, allowing them to zoom in on an area using it.

Test 914-0261
Name: Dr. Devant. Thaumatology researcher.
I hope to find answers where Dr. Mason only found SCP-914 messing with him. - Dr. Devant
Date: 03/10/2018
Total Items: 5 Thaumatologicaly crafted letters (acting as a tracking beacons) in envelopes that will remotely write the path taken on an associated paper sheet outside of SCP-914. These letters are also sealed close with special trigger symbols in sealing wax that, when traversing boundaries of realities or alternate universes, will trigger the associated wax candles outside of SCP-914 to light themselves.

Input: 1 tracking envelope.
Setting: Rough
Output: A small pile of cinnabar, a tiny beeswax honeycomb structure, scraps of paper and a small pile of glitter (presumed to be the thaumatological writing from the letter).
Notes: The candle did not light, an outline of a human face was drawn on the paper sheet.
Yes! we're getting somewhere. No way this drawing could form the Foundation logo. - Dr. Devant

Input: 1 tracking envelope.
Setting: Coarse
Output: 1 unfolded envelope (no visible markings), one letter with SCP-3669-2 notation in glittery black ink. One unbroken wax seal with the stylized initials C.F. stamped on it.
Notes: The candle did not light, the paper showed a zig-zagging pattern being drawn across it.
The arrows on the letter do not match the chaotic movement on the paper. I'll have the letter analysed by another department. - Dr. Devant

Input: 1 tracking envelope.
Setting: 1:1
Output: A punch card labeled "FORTRAN STATEMENT" wherein 688 of the 800 positions were punched. Each of the punched holes had a shape of thaumatological significance. The surface of the card feels "waxy" and has a slight glitter like glint to it. The nature of the program on the card is being analysed by the anomalous computing dept.
Notes: The candle produced a small puff of smoke, but did not light. On the sheet of paper a pair of human eyes were drawn.
While the results of the candle were inconclusive, SCP-914 seems to be drawing a human face.
I'm beginning to believe that my plan has already failed. - Dr. Devant

Input: 1 tracking envelope.
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 origami helicopter (modeled after a Bell UH-1 Iroquois), the windows are painted on with glittery black ink, the engine compartment is made of red sealing wax. After manually winding the blades the helicopter can fly a short distance in a random direction.
Notes: The candle produced a small spark and puff of smoke. A pair of human ears, a human nose & voluptuous lips were drawn on the paper.
I'm not quite sure what the candle is signaling here, it should just light itself when the seal traverses to another reality, this effect needs further investigation. The face drawn on the tracking papers is too crude to do any facial recognition on, lets see if the Very Fine setting helps. - Dr. Devant

Input: 1 tracking envelope.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 wax sealed envelope, addressed to the high school nickname of Dr. Devant, the seal was stamped with a heart symbol. Inside the envelope was a letter of rejection to Dr. Devant, written in black glittery ink. This letter is currently being investigated for cognitohazardous effects.
Notes: The candle was lit. The paper had random scribbles all over. When all five outputs on the papers were overlaid it produced a sketch of ████████ ████████████ (now deceased), a helicopter pilot and former high school romantic interest of Dr. Devant. Dr. Devant has been placed in the psych ward after excessive sobbing and showing of suicidal tendencies.

This one's odd to me. All my experiments so far have conformed to the belief that SCP-914 works via associations of the operator. Unless the good Doctor can tell me otherwise, that doesn't seem to be the case here. I would suggest against using thaumaturgy on 914, it's already weird enough as is. -Researcher K. Midaeus

Test 914-0262
Name: Researcher L. Sheele
Date: 19/10/2018
Total Items: One plastic bowl of various brands of store purchased candy, and one note containing the words "Take three pieces please."
Note - I'm hoping to get something similar to SCP-330, but less… endangering to the trick-or-treaters. -Researcher L. Sheele

Input: Aforementioned candy bowl and note.
Setting: Fine
Output: The same candy bowl and note, but with three pieces removed and set to the floor beside it. The three extracted pieces are unable to be consumed; subjects who attempt to will instead insist they are "for someone else." Remaining pieces show no anomalous properties.
Note 2- You cannot be serious. This thing is just one big clockwork smartass. -Researcher L. Sheele

Input: Previous bowl containing the remaining candy and note attached.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Contents unchanged, no effects apparent until all candy is removed. Once emptied, subjects who observe the bowl will feel excessively compulsed to fill it and will attempt to do so with anything available, including liquids, possessions of significance to the subject, vital organs (if tools capable of incision are provided,) and materials found hazardous to the subject or container. Effects are not present to those who view the object through camera feeds or photographs. Contents of the bowl showed no remarkable properties.

Subject(s): D-33874-914
Provision(s): Original contents of bowl.
Results: Subject's view of the item was obscured and was placed into testing area; contents of bowl removed and placed on a separate table. Upon making eye contact, the subject became visibly distraught and made numerous agitated exclaims about the sight before beginning to fill the bowl with candy. Once this task was completed, the subject resumed in a stable emotional state.

Subject(s): D-33874-914
Provision(s): Approximately one hundred and fifty [REDACTED], provided in a steel container and heated to 73 degrees Celsius.
Results: Subject was set up as before and told to look at the empty bowl, displaying a similar reaction to the previous experiment. After about a minute of this, D-33874 approached the container and attempted to relocate them into the bowl. Subject was successful in removing a total of four [REDACTED], receiving multiple third degree burns to both hands. Subject was detained after attempting to retrieve a fifth orally. A full analysis shows the subject has yet to recover from the effects of the object. The object received significant burns and became warped in several places.

[DATA EXPUNGED]

Note 3: The remaining tests have been removed for brevity. The object has been sent to an anomalous item storage facility and is pending classification, but I think I need to make this clarification here: I would recommend being a lot more cautious in the future regarding testing of objects produced by the "Very Fine" setting of SCP-914. They're hard to manage, harder to predict and even harder to clean up after. That will be all. -Dr. Clarentine.

Testing on the assembled model reveals no anomalous properties other than a memetic sense of pride upon viewing the assembled model. Object left in staff room for Staff to examine at their leisure.

Test 914-0264
Name: Junior Researcher Gregorius
Date: ██/11/20██
Total Items: Two chessboards, wood with wooden pieces, initial configuration. Two booklets describing the basic rules of chess, in English.

Note - We know what 914 does with a chessboard on 1:1. I wonder what it does on other settings. - Jr. Researcher Gregorius

Input: One chessboard, one booklet
Setting: Fine
Output: One translucent "3D Chess" cube with pieces, one booklet describing the rules of "3D Chess" in 18th century Russian. The cube is made of a cellulose and protein-based aerogel with a wooden base. It is subdivided into 8x8x8 smaller cubes, the sides of which are equal in length to the sides of the fields on the original chessboard. These cubes are alternately light and dark colored. The pieces are made of hollow wood but are identical to the original pieces. Each side has sixty-four pawns, sixteen rooks, knights and bishops, eight queens, and eight kings. The pieces are arranged in columns in the original starting configuration but the booklet describes alternative starting configurations available to the players. The base has controls for highlighting one horizontal or vertical plane of the cube, this lighting operates from two AA-size batteries (not included). This highlight is non-anomalous, using ultrasound emitted from miniature speakers in the base in combination with sound-activated bioluminescent proteins in the aerogel. The total mass of the outputs is identical to the mass of the input items.
The aerogel yields easily to human touch, allowing players to move the pieces. Once the player removes their hand, the gel quickly expands to refill the space left behind retaining the original coloration of the cubes.
The rules described in the booklet are generally a more restrictive extrapolation of normal 2D chess rules when multiple extrapolations would be possible (for example, pawns can still only move in one direction, and bishops need to move in all three dimensions at once).
After sampling the aerogel, the item was assigned to Site-19 breakroom. A translation of the rule booklet is available on the intranet.

Note - due to the large number of pieces and the need to capture 7 out of the 8 kings before the last king can be put into checkmate, the games are expected to take quite long. Prospective players should allocate their break time accordingly. Also, a computer version of the game is available on the intranet if you'd like to practice for the upcoming tournament. - Jr. Researcher Gregorius

Input: One chessboard, one booklet
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One apparently wooden disk with "4D Chess" printed on it, one combined instruction manual and rule booklet in contemporary Navajo transcribed in Greek script.
When two players touch the disk simultaneously, an image of a four-dimensional hypercube is projected into their minds. The pieces inside the hypercube are arranged in a way similar to the 3D version. The players can move the pieces with mental commands. While touching the disk, they can conceptualize and visualize the four-dimensional space as easily as they would a normal three-dimensional space. This ability only lasts as long as they are touching the game but isn't limited to the game space. The rules of the game are similar to those of the 3D version.
Item assigned to Site-19 breakroom.

I'd like to requisition this item to help in my higher-dimensional topology research - Jr. Researcher C███████.
Granted. Just return it to the breakroom when you're finished - O5-██

Date: 10/11/2018
Total Items: One standard 12-inch steel ruler.

Input: One Ruler
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A ruler that can tell the length of any object it is set upon in inches. The ruler then messages how long said object it is placed upon by sending a text message to the person who placed it on the objects' phone, if the person who placed the ruler has no phone, they will receive a letter with the length of the measured item within the next hour, regardless of where they are, and who they are. Both the text message and the letter say that they come from "unknown contact" and are sent from the coordinates of the ruler at the time the object was measured. Attempts to trace the contact have resulted in the location of the ruler.

Note: This is surprisingly useful. -Researcher Harris

Test 914-0276
Name: Chief Security Officer Wright

Test 914-0277
Name: Dr. Lefèvre‑Gineau
Date: 12/11/2018
Total Items: Five copies of the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK), these metal cylinders are made of a platinum-iridium alloy at a 9 to 1 ratio. These (soon to be obsolete) weights are used as the standard to define the kilogram.

Input: One IPK
Setting: Rough
Output: One 902.36g cube of platinum & One 97.64g sphere of iridium.

Input: One IPK
Setting: Coarse
Output: One platinum-iridium alloy meteorite, when cut in half the meteorite showed a Widmanstätten pattern.

Normally the Widmanstätten pattern would not form in a platinum-iridium based meteorite. The sight is mesmerizing though - Dr. Lefèvre‑Gineau

Input: One IPK
Setting: 1:1
Output: One platinum-iridium alloy rod precisely 1 meter long with a diameter of roughly 3.88mm.

Input: One IPK
Setting: Fine
Output: One square platinum plate with an iridium "antenna" protruding on its far side. The plate has a radial meter embossed on its center ranging from 0 to 5, from its center protrudes an iridium needle pointing towards the "one" position. This needle moves to higher & lower positions when the device is pointed toward anomalous phenomena. No interior parts have been found.

I believe this device to be a hume-meter of some kind, however, it responds to anomalous objects in different ways than a standard Foundation hume-meter, as if it's measuring true reality compared to relative reality. - Dr. Lefèvre‑Gineau

Input: One IPK
Setting: Very fine
Output: One platinum weighing mass with tapered handle & ornate embossments of the phrase "1 kilogram" in various languages. X-ray imaging of the device showed an internal space filled with iridium metal parts moving continuously and chaotically. Its anomalous effect is made apparent when the "weight" is placed on the surface of an object that is not fastened to the ground in some way, this object will now weigh exactly one kilogram regardless of local gravity or acceleration. The object behaves like a regular weighing mass when used on a balance scale.

I recommend using magnetic boots when carrying this weight, walking whilst weighing only one kilo has proven to be very difficult. Dr. Lefèvre‑Gineau

That sounds like a hate rant by 914. Also, is it implying that she (2118) will be released from Foundation custody in the future? -Dr. Cleveland

Input: Personnel File of MT Johnson
Setting: Fine
Output: Two documents. One is a wanted list by Interpol, dated August 31, 203█, including MT Johnson, researchers Isaac D., Dr. Cleveland, Dr. Veritas, Dr. Gears, Dr. Rights, O5-█, O5-██, the entire Bright family, and Administrators [DATA EXPUNGED]. The other is a news article from The New York Times, dated September 11, 202█, detailing the start of a war crimes trial, in which O5-█ is trialled for funding the Rwandan Genocide, for assassinating Vice President and President-elect of the United States Al Gore on December 24, 2000, and for orchestrating the September 11 attacks, which killed President Joe Lieberman. Documents confirmed to be from a parallel universe in which the Foundation collapsed in 20██, likely from the same universe as The Eleventh Hour, as the book mentioned that the trial of O5-█ was ongoing in its epilogue.

Note: I will need a Class-A amnestic for this. And it's just the Fine setting! You snarky ████████████, 914. -Dr. Cleveland

Note: Documents were directly handed to O5-█ due to its severity. - Site Command

Come on, another hate rant? And to say that the Foundation was solely responsible for all genocide campaigns in the 20th Century is utter ████████. Nazism was a real thing, for starters. Also, recognize the facts and the severity of the so-called God Gene before giving this kind of anti-Foundation propaganda. Though to their credit, they did manage to obliterate that fallen star. Parts of the Anthology could be a great referential tool. -Dr. Cleveland

Input: Lock of hair from entity (testing approved by the O5 Council as the entity is not hostile)
Setting: Fine
Output: The hair is apparently tied into the form of the 10_11 knot.

Input: One Aforementioned Air Rifle
Setting: 1:1
Output: One custom Daisy "Red Ryder" carbine-action, two hundred shot Range Model air rifle with a compass and sundial in the stock. The rifle was briefly tested on the firing range, determined to be non-anomalous, and produced results which were within one standard deviation of a normal Red Ryder.

Note: At this point, Researcher Reis instructed that the rifle be tested at the firing range while she retrieved something, and left the testing chamber. She returned with a thumb drive and added an impromptu step to the end of planned procedure.

Input: One Aforementioned Air Rifle
Setting: Fine
Output: One Daisy "Buck Jones" Air Rifle. When test-fired, the actual muzzle velocity was equivalent to the maximum muzzle velocity of an average Buck Jones rifle. Shots were also more accurate at range despite being smooth-bore. No other anomalous properties were detected.

Input: One Aforementioned Air Rifle
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One Gaussian Handcannon with a miniature sextant and a spring-powered clock in the butt. Weight was equivalent to input rifle. Clock is functional but unwound, ammunition and batteries were not included. Object being tested for anomalous properties prior to test-firing.

Input: One Custom Daisy "Red Ryder" from prior test, 1 Thumb Drive containing one copy of A Christmas Story
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One Custom Daisy "Red Ryder" carbine-action, two hundred shot Range Model air rifle with a compass and sundial in the stock. Further inspection reveals the stock is engraved with the words "Ol' Blue". The rifle appears to have a memetic effect; if an individual attempts to aim it while observers are present, one will state "You'll shoot your eye out." It is unknown if the gun has any secondary properties, as nobody has fired it. Object has been contained in a gun safe, awaiting further classification.

Note: Under no circumstances should anyone with an instance of SCP-718 be permitted to touch this. - 05-█

Note: So I got the song I wanted, but the crank keeps jamming when I turn it three or four times. "Let it go?" More like: "Leave it be." - Dr. Baumgartner

Input: One musical box
Setting: Fine
Output: A music box without the wind-up that plays "If you wish upon a star." without pause. Was dismantled in an attempt to discern its power source, only for the anomalous activity to cease.

Notes: Honestly, it was getting quite a bit on my nerves. - Dr. Baumgartner

Input: One musical box.
Setting: Very fine.
Output: One wind-up musical box. Upon being wound up, the box plays soundtrack from various Movies, Series and video games that are generally associated with childhood memories, or otherwise possess strong sentimental value to the person winding it.

Output: Two dark tinted monocles. No anomalous properties.

//Note: Uh, that was unexpected. I would've thought that the result would be a super good pair of glasses or something like that. I guess it works though. - Researcher Mikk

Input: A pair of "Versace" brand spectacles
Setting: Very fine
Output: One knife with a glass blade. When used to cut something, it will heat up to roughly 3000°C. This heat is strong enough to cut iron, gold and steel, and has proven to be a great weapon, if not completely deadly as the heat from the blade completely cauterizes the wound, stopping external bleeding but causing severe internal bleeding. Strangely, the heat does not seem to affect the holder of the knife, who does not need to wear any protective gear or get any burns on their body. Further analysis needed. It is currently being held in the Site-37 armory.

Note: I guess you could call this… a glass cannon? - Researcher Mikk

Note: I moved the knife to a containment locker, where it belongs. And Mikk, I'm revoking your testing privileges for this and for that last joke. - Veritas

Note: I'm guessing some kind of Enigma code? Maybe a modified version of Caesar?

Input: Output from 1:1 experiment

Note: Might as well see if we can't get anything more vibrant.

Setting: Fine
Output: A holographic rainbow coated sketchbook. Anomalous property realized when attempting to draw in the sketchbook. All users will, regardless of previous artistic skill, seemingly have the ability to draw anything they can desire, with no inherent flaws in the design. It also appears to have an infinite amount of paper

Note: Would be pretty useful to have in the break room. If not, I'd just love to put this on my desk.

Theorized to be from a world where either the Foundation never formed, or SCP-105 never discovered her anomalous abilities.

Eh, that wasn't what I had in mind. -Cleveland

How the hell did he get my personnel file?! -Dr. Calloway

Input: 1 photo of O5-9
Setting: Fine
Output: 1 photo of O5-9 (geologist Dr. Donna Taylor) leading a group of students to explore the Diahot River in New Caledonia. Except for one subsequently identified as Virginia Toy, the identities of the students are unknown.

Test 914-0347
Name: Researcher Ed
Date: 15/01/2019
Total Items: 5 Nintendo Brand DOL-003 Gamecube Controllers

Input: 1 Gamecube Controller
Setting: Coarse
Output: A pile of various electronic components.

Input: 1 Gamecube Controller
Setting: 1:1
Output: One MadCatz Gamecube Controller

Huh, would have guessed another controller from a different console. -Researcher Ed

Input: 1 Gamecube Controller
Setting: Fine
Output: One Generic Gamecube controller. When used, the plastic seems to form to support the user's hand. Additionally, all buttons except for the shoulder buttons have an extremely short travel distance, and therefore responsiveness.

Upon prolonged use, the controller heated up and fused with another researcher's hand, causing fourth-degree burns, and destroying itself in the process.

Input: Two Gamecube controllers
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One Generic Gamecube controller. However, when collected, the controller appeared to fuse with Researcher Ed's hand quickly, causing 5th-degree burns. After the fusing "process" finished, Researcher Ed's hands had become black, amorphous objects. Upon a medical examination, it appears that his hands have completely disappeared. Examination of the black amorphous objects have shown that it contains some kind of alloy, additionally, it appears Researcher Ed has a degree of control shaping the objects into an imaginable solid made of the alloy. Further testing is required.

This is a weird feeling. I can feel whatever these touch, even though they aren't fingers. Also it really hurt. It's also an experience relearning to type and write with these "fingers" -Researcher Ed

Test 914-0348
Name: Detective Brandt

Total Items: A photograph of Researcher I. Darby and an arrest warrant for said Researcher.

Input: Above Mentioned
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A Photograph of Researcher I. Darby that shows his actions, no time of reference is included so no information can be granted from said photograph. Arrest warrant has been folded in shape of a small German Shepherd and is completely animate.

Note: First off, HOW THE HELL DID A POLICEMAN GET INSIDE THE FACILITY?! Second, why did you let him walk out of here after using 914? - Security Overseer Brundon

Note: How this man managed to enter this facility aside, given the arrest warrant, will someone please do a background check on Researcher Isaac Darby? The last thing we want is a criminal in charge of these experiments. - Dr. ██████

Note: The detective was administered amnestics. I would also really appreciate it if you yelled at the Human Resources instead. - Dr. Veritas

Test 914-0350
Name: Dr. Natalidae
Date: 17/01/2019
Total Items: Three $1 USD bills

Input: One bill
Setting: 1:1
Output: One $1 USD coin, which appears to have been made by tightly compressing the original paper bill into the shape of a coin.

Input: One bill
Setting: 1:1
Output: One "-$1" USD bill, which largely resembles a standard $1 USD bill except that all instances of "1" are replaced with "-1", and the print's color has been inverted as if it were a photonegative of the original bill. It is assumed that this bill represents a negative amount of currency but otherwise displays no abnormal properties.

Note: Still having trouble wrapping my head around how this would work in normal economics. - Dr. Natalidae

Input: One bill
Setting: Fine
Output: One visually unaltered $1 bill. When assigned D-Class was about to retrieve the output, it autonomously shifted out of his reach. Subsequent attempts to capture the output were met with similar resistance, with it rapidly outmanoeuvring anyone who came near it. The bill was able to escape the testing chamber and went out into the halls of Facility 23, where it spent a total of 43 minutes eluding capture attempts until several researchers coordinated to corner and trap it in the incinerator room, where it was promptly disposed of.

Test 914-0351
Name: Assistant Researcher Johannes
Date: 17/01/2019
Total Items: 1 piece of empty sheet music, 1 jar of ink.

Note: Since I'm such a creativity nut, lets see if 914 can create music.

Input: Above materials
Setting: fine
Output: 1 piece of ink-soggy sheet music, 1 toppled over jar of ink. Surprisingly, there does appear to be notes placed on the lines, and further examination shows it to be an excerpt of Franz Liszt's etude "La Campanella". It is unknown if the jar of ink tipping over was accidental or purposeful work of SCP-914.

Note: Well, It did technically qualify for the results of the experiment, but now I'm wondering why it would choose such a weird etude to print, considering it was one of the etudes where it's artist was accused of selling their soul to the devil just to print and play it.

Test 914-0352
Name: Dr. Playford
Date: 17/01/2019
Total Items: Five magnifying glasses with a plastic handle

Input: One magnifying glass
Setting: Rough
Output: Cut up pieces of plastic and glass shards

Input: One magnifying glass
Setting: Coarse
Output: Disassembled magnifying glass

Input: One magnifying glass
Setting: 1:1
Output: Magnifying glass with a concave lens

Input: One magnifying glass
Setting: Fine
Output: The plastic was changed into a lens shaped object in a glass frame, and was noted to vibrate slightly, further inspection revealed it treated sound as light, the focal points for the sound being the same as the original lens.

Note: Item handed over to the acoustics lab for further inspection. – Dr. Playford

Input: One magnifying glass
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Plastic cylinder 4cm in diameter and 5 in length, with an undetermined number and configuration of lenses inside, the object can be looked through either end. It displays an orthographic projection of whatever the object is pointed at.

Note: We pointed this thing at the Moon and managed to see individual pebbles and dust particles on the lunar surface, however, due to the nature of orthographic projection, only a 12.5cm2 area can be observed, making this an extremely powerful telescope, as long as you only want to see post-it sized bits of whatever you’re looking at. – Dr. Playford

Input: The Gun that Changed the World, USB
Setting: Very Fine
Output: What appears to be an autobiography of a "Stanislava Mikhailovna Kalashnikova" titled The Artificial Daughter, dated 2064. Reference material not found in the book is in the form of two 32GB SD cards. Experimenting showed that there is a 0.4 percent chance that when placed in the vicinity of a submachine gun, it would convert into an AKS-74U. Placed in secure storage as Kalashnikov never had a daughter named Stanislava.

Test 914-0356
Name: Dr Hadian
Date: 18/01/2019
Total Items: One model clock, unpainted, carved from balsa wood. (It should be noted for the record that the model is made of one continuous mass and is completely lacking in functionality, resembling a clock in appearance only.)

Input: One model clock
Setting: Rough
Output: Several wooden gears and casing, as well as a pile of sawdust.

Input: The output of the previous test
Setting: Fine
Output: An ornate hourglass, several times the size of the original clock. The mass has remained consistent, and the "glass" portion of the device appears to be a form of cellulose.

Note: The output of this experiment is no longer available; upon emptying, the hourglass disintegrated into sawdust, and no attempt at re-integration has yet been made.

Test 914-0358
Name: Dr. Cleveland
Date: 20/01/2019
Total Items: Files pertaining to Mary Talish, a biography of former President Richard Nixon authored by John A. Farrell (Richard Nixon: The Life), An American Life authored by former President Ronald Reagan, Known and Unknown: A Memoir by Donald Rumsfeld

Input: All of the above
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Four books:
1. A book titled They Led Us to Midnight: The Last Presidents of America, authored by Doris Goodwin, dated 2015. This book mentions the last presidents of the United States as Richard Nixon (1969-1977, 37th), Jerry Brown (1977-1981, 38th), Ronald Reagan (1981-1985, 39th), Mary Talish (1985-1989, 40th), and Donald Rumsfeld (1989-1993, 41st). The 25 years were marred with controversy, and culminated with a nuclear war with the Soviet Union under Gennady Yanayev (General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 1985-1993) after a nuclear false alarm on November 22, 1993. It was stated that a system malfunction in the Dead Hand / Perimeter nuclear weapons control system misinterpreted a background signal as 6 Minuteman ICBMs heading for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, thus causing the nuclear war.
2. An autobiography titled Murder, They Wrote by Mary Talish, dated 1992. It details her ritual murder and subsequent resurrection in 1952, her senatorial career from 1967 to 1977, her vice presidency from 1977 to 1981, and her presidency from 1985 to 1989. A foreword, written by Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter, suggested that American-Soviet relations deteriorated rapidly after Talish's presidency ended.
3. A book titled United Counties of Indiana: The Founding of a Nation by Former Governor of Illinois James R. Thompson, dated 2015. It detailed the first twenty years of Indiana and Illinois after the Nuclear War of 1993. Of note was the appearance of Site-81 Director Oliver J. Rights as President of Indiana from 2007 to 2011.
4. An autobiography titled Our Struggle: Memories of Athens by Alexis Tsipras, Prime Minister of the Imperial Union of Greece, Samothrace, Cyprus and Turkey (Greek: Η Αυτοκρατορική Ένωση της Ελλάδας, η Σαμοθράκη, η Κύπρος και η Τουρκία), dated 2020. It detailed his life from after the nuclear war, being one of the few who witnessed a nuclear bomb hitting Athens without exploding. The current monarch is Paul II (Pavlos II), following Constantine II's abdication in 1996 in exchange for the restoration of the Greek Monarchy.
In books 1 and 4, a world map is seen. One could infer that continental Eurasia, the British Isles, the former Soviet Union, and North America is heavily devastated. All four placed into secure storage pending further review.
Note: So it turns out that Mary Talish could have done much more in her life. However, a nuclear war is probably the last thing we would want to see. -Cleveland

Input: Above mentioned.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: A copy of Super Smash Bros Ultimate but all the characters are replaced with Lucas. Their animations are the same but with the Lucas Model using it. All the soundtracks have also been replaced by remixes of the announcer saying “Lucas.”

Note: I, personally, am not a fan. -Dr. Nukea

Test 914-0362
Name: Maintenance Technician Johnson
Date: 23/01/2019
Total Items: One 10cm cube of steel, one artificial fireplace log, the contents of 10 bags of ██████
brand fruit snacks

Note: Since 914 at least partially operates by intent of the operator and purpose of the items inserted, I want to see how it reacts to a set of items with no single purpose. Don't worry, neither the log nor the fruit snacks contain any natural ingredients, so there's no chance of biological contamination.

Input: All of the above
Setting: Very Fine
Output: One 20 cm cube of an unknown alloy. Testing shows it to be made up of an even mix of all of the input items. The alloy has a much worse structural stability than steel, as well as the anomalous properties of being flammable and gaining the same texture and hardness of a fruit snack when bitten into. However, the combination of materials making it up would mean that any attempt to eat any amount of it would almost certainly be fatal.

Note: I wasn't expecting it to give me something as cohesive as this. It almost seems like it noticed that I was more interested in it rather than the stuff I was putting into it and didn't put much effort into refining the materials. If we ever need a small supply of a structurally unstable, flammable, and edible metal, it'll be in anomalous item storage. - MT Johnson

Test 914-0363
Name: Dr. Cleveland

Test 914-0367
Name: Researcher Boston K.
Date: 24/01/2019
Total Items: Three binders full of SCP files.

Input: One black binder containing files of SCP-1100 through SCP-1399.
Setting: 1:1
Output: One blue and green binder, containing the plots of all Shaun the Sheep episodes.
Note: What else could I say but "thank you"? -Boston

Input: One white binder containing files of SCP-2700 through SCP-2999, with a small note in front stating that SCP-2935 is not included.
Setting: Fine
Output: A novel titled Dead Days, ostensibly authored by alternatehistory.com Administrator Ian. The premise is the mass teleportation of Utah, the Colorado Western Slope, the Navajo and Hopi Nations (sans Tohajilee Indian Reservation), San Juan, McKinley and Cibola Counties, NM, Alamo, NM and Uinta County, WY from SCP-2935 on April 20, 2026, to the regular world on April 20, 1626, and at the same time resurrecting everyone within it.
Note: 914, you are a God forsaken heretic. -Boston

Input: One red binder containing files of SCP-3700 through SCP-3999, with the front cover printed with a warning stating that SCP-3930 does not exist.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The first item that came out was an anti-Foundation poster by the Christian Democratic Union, dated 2017. On it was the Foundation logo with a Swastika in the middle. The texts read "Secure. Contain. Protect. Exterminate." (Sichern. Enthalten. Schützen. Vernichten.), "Never Forget the Holocaust." (Vergiss Niemals den Holocaust.), and "Vote for the Union Parties." (Stimmen Sie für die Unionsparteien.) It should be noted that according to The Eleventh Hour, Germany was part of the United States-led Bloomington Alliance (other important members included Poland, Italy and India, with Russia being in an associated state status), which uprooted much of the SCP Foundation in a ten-year war (it was a few years after the war ended when the titular military operation took place).
The second item was a political commentary by Popular Socialist Party of Mexico Chairwoman Esther Amalia Zapatista titled Our Ultimate Revolution: 13 Reasons Why Capitalism Will Fail, dated 2047. In the book, Ms. Zapatista claimed that the existing Capitalist world is fundamentally flawed, and with the possible yet controversial exceptions of Cuba, Finland, Iceland, and Estonia, no country has came close to attaining real, egalitarian Socialism. The opening quote of the book, "You don't walk away from Gethsemane", implies that blood would be shed on the path to achieving Socialism.
Both items placed into secure storage.

Note: And here I was, thinking what the absolute ████ was wrong with the existing system. This Zapatista person sure is good at debating and persuading, but the problem is: in a world of political █████████, can Socialism ever triumph? - Boston

Note: When you're done debating philosophy with a malfunctioning inanimate object, Site Director Hackett would like to know how you obtained 898 classified files, some of which above your clearance level. Don't tell me, I don't want to know. - Dr. Veritas

Test 914-0368
Name: Assistant Researcher Erickson
Date: 26/01/2019
Total Items: Two flash-drives, each containing the entire foundation dossier on Dr. Beiderman.

Note: This test was never approved by any senior staff.

Input: One flash-drive.
Setting: Fine
Output: One bust of Dr. Beiderman, made out of the same materials as the hard drive, with an equivalent mass.

That's not what I needed, 914. C'mon, help me out here. I need to find him. -Assistant Researcher Erickson.

Input: One flash-drive.
Setting: Fine
Output: One flash-drive. Said flash-drive contained all previously redacted details on the current whereabouts of Dr. Beiderman.

Note: Thank you 914. -Assistant Researcher Erickson

Note: The current whereabouts of Assistant Researcher Erickson are unknown. Anybody who encounters him is to apprehend him IMMEDIATELY. He is in possession of information above his clearance level.- Security Chief Ozark

Test 914-0369
Name: Jr. Researcher Stan
Date: 26/01/2019
Total Items: One solid-state USB drive with a capacity of 128 GB. Drive is empty and unformatted.

Note: I wanted to see if 914 could write information onto a drive, and if so what it might put in there. I have a Windows computer on a closed system with no internet or system access. This will be tested with the drive. - Stan

Input: One SSD, empty
Setting: 1:1
Output: One SSD with a USB compatibility. Appears to be a different model than the input device. The drive has a small switch on the top, with the activated position marked with an engraved 'X'. The computer appeared unable to recognize the drive when plugged in, disallowing any manual transferring of files. When the switch was pushed to the 'X' position, the computer malfunctioned. Upon further testing, it appears the drive deletes "System32" off of any computer running Windows OS when the switch is activated. Item has no effect on non-Windows operating systems.

Note: Later that day, a researcher wearing a plastic Guy Fawkes mask entered secure storage using proper security clearance and stole the drive. All Windows computers connected to the Foundation system later came under malware attack despite foundation security software and were disabled via deletion of System32. The researcher responsible was identified through the records of the security card scanner. The researcher has been fired and amnesticized.

Note: I don't think he realized that all of the important Foundation computers run SCP OS. -Stan

Total Items: five pieces of sourdough bread.

Input: One piece of sourdough bread.
Setting: Fine.
Output: One piece of toasted sourdough bread.

Input: One piece of sourdough bread.
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Appeared to be above piece of bread, however, on contact with open air, it began to grow exponentially, until the testing chamber was filled. Testing revealed that the yeast inside of the bread had been modified to produce gas at increased rates. Bread was incinerated.

Note: Remaining proposed tests aborted. I understand that the plant life was overlooked, but this serves as a warning. Living organisms are still Living organisms, and require O5 approval. - Veritas

Test 914-0378
Name: Dr. Nukea
Date: 30/01/2019
Total items: Two copies of 17 again.

Input: A copy of 17 again
Setting: Fine
Output: A copy of 17 again but it’s animated and the main character Mike O’Donnel has been replaced by Wolf O’Donnel from the Star Fox series.

It was decent, I guess. -Dr. Nukea

Input: A copy of 17 again
Setting: 1:1
Output: A copy of 13 going on 30

I’m a huge fan of 17 again. But 13 going on 30 isn’t my cup of tea. I’m leaving it in the break room if anyone wants to watch it. I might put more of my copies of 17 again into SCP 914. -Dr. Nukea

Note: …How many copies do you need in life, Nukea? - Veritas

Test 914-0379
Name: Dr.Peterson

Test 914-0380
Name: Dr. Fiael, MD
Date: 30/01/2019
Total Items: 5 complete SynCardiaTM brand total artificial hearts (TAH)

Input: 1 TAH
Setting: Rough
Output: Pile of plastic (biocompatible), Velcro, magnets of varying shape and size, and a patent for the device printed on squares of antimicrobial cloth, which appear in several languages (English, Chinese, German, Japanese).

Input: 1 TAH
Setting: Coarse
Output: A metallic box that has four chambers of equal size and outflow valves to and from each. The chambers are lined on all interior surfaces with biocompatibale plastic. Attached to the exterior of the box is a handle, which is attached to a crank. The crank moves fluid through the box for as long as manual force is applied to it.

Input: 1 TAH
Setting: 1:1
Output: Two ventricular assist devices, one intended for placement in the right side of the heart; the other intended for placement in the left side of the heart.

Note: The output machines each take the function of the heart's pumping action. The one intended for the right side of the heart isn't used much in practice due to high risk of complications, which is why the TAH was created. Essentially, 1 artificial heart = two 12 artificial hearts.

Input: 1 TAH
Setting: Fine
Output: Nothing is initially observed in the output chamber. Closer inspection of the surfaces shows a thin accumulation of dust that was not present previously. The dust is later revealed to be millions of individual nanoparticulate mechanisms. Chemical analysis of the immediate environment as well as shavings of the output chamber's interior reveal a significant increase in oxygen and extrinsic nutrients.

Note: The purpose of the cardiovascular system is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. The nanoparticles apparently achieve this via controlled diffusion, without the need for an organ or delivery system.

Input: 1 TAH
Setting: Very Fine
Output: Native materials of the TAH have been rearranged to resemble several fruits and vegetables (inedible). A perfectly functioning pedometer was also retrieved.

Note: Seems to be suggesting preventative care.

Test 914-0381
Name: Maintenance Technician Johnson
Date: 30/01/2019
Total Items: 3 abridged copies of MT Johnson's personnel file, which have been scrubbed of all sensitive information
Note: Since 914 partially operates by intent of the operator, let's see what happens when I create some feedback by putting in information about myself.

Input: 1 abridged copy of MT Johnson's personnel file
Setting: 1:1
Output: A copy of the mission statement of the Department of Maintenance, an obscure department which is responsible for the upkeep of SCP containment enclosures.
Note: If no one's heard of us, then that mean's we're doing our jobs correctly. - MT Johnson

Input: 1 abridged copy of MT Johnson's personnel file
Setting: Fine
Output: One large origami wrench embossed with the words "Secure, Maintain, Protect"

Note: About what I expected, but that's not the Foundation's actual slogan. Perhaps it's my perception of it? - MT Johnson

Input: 1 abridged copy of MT Johnson's personnel file
Setting: Very Fine
Output: The file now contains several pages of the word "maintain" handwritten over and over in printer ink. Writing confirmed as identical to that of MT Johnson. Writing starts out normally but gets rougher and rougher as it progresses, as well as containing an increasing number of capital letters. By the end it is barely legible as well as being entirely capitalized. The folder has what appears to be an emblem made up of a pair of crossed wrenches pressed into it's front and back as well.

Note: This feels like its from the typewriter scene from The Shining. I'm just going to leave this in secure storage and try to forget that this ever happened. - MT Johnson

Input: 1 DVD Box Set
Setting: 1:1
Output: One DVD box set of all the Monty Python movies. No observable anomalous effects.

Note: Left in anomalous items storage, just in case. Yes, I know I'm overly paranoid. Please stop bugging me about it. It's hard to tell what's normal and what's not when it comes to Monty Python reactions. - Dr. Greenway

Input: 1 DVD Box Set
Setting: Fine
Output: One mosaic of the Monty Python comedy group, using the plastic packaging as backing. Confirmed to match an existing photograph. Observers profess approval of the persons depicted, even if they have never heard of Monty Python before.

Note: I left it in the part of the anomalous item storage wing reserved for stuff from 914, right next to the DVD box set.

Input: 1 DVD Box Set
Setting: Very Fine
Output: 1 unmarked box containing one very large DVD. It was found to contain θ' seasons of a cognitohazardous TV show that causes all viewers of it to fall into a coma. Application of amnestics reverses these effects.

Test 914-0395
Name: Jr. Researcher Micheal Isalo
Date: 07/02/2019
Total Items: Three 1 dram samples of SCP-837

Input: 1 dram of SCP-837, rolled into a ball.
Setting: Rough
Output: The entire 3mx2.1mx2.1m output chamber was initially filled with clay, with small lines noticeable along the surface. Upon applying slight pressure to empty the chamber, the clay began collapsing in on itself, eventually setting down to a single dram of clay. Final sample demonstrates consistent properties of SCP-837.

Input: 1 dram of SCP-837, rolled into a ball.
Setting: Coarse
Output: 2 clay balls of different sizes, measured as weighing 2 drams and 0.5 drams. Both balls were able to have 1 dram chunks removed without affecting mass, consistent with SCP-837. While the 2 dram ball could be combined and removed as normal, adding the 0.5 dram sample to a 3 dram sample resulted in a 1.5 dram sample which could not be restored. Adding the 2 dram sample resulted in a standard 3 dram sample, which could not be further factorized.

Input: 1 dram of SCP-837, rolled into a ball
Setting: 1:1
Output: 1 clay ball, weighing 1 pennyweight, exhibiting similar features to SCP-837. Sample could not be combined with standard instances of SCP-837. As well, output chamber contained a small pile of non-anomalous clay weighing just under 217 mg (the weight difference between 1 dram and 1 pennyweight.)
